# Plants in Space (PiS)

This is a action rural life time, inspired by the likes of Harvest Moon, 
Rune Factory and Innocent Life. It is being developed in rust on the
bevy game engine.

# Intent

This game is open source, however, funding support for this project
will likely be done through official steam builds. Before contributing
please discuss with me so that I can provide a contributor agreement.
